# temp_fedora_postinstall_diff
A temporary repository to compare changes between a fork of the popular Fedora post-install script made by Tobias (https://git.furworks.de/tobias/fedora-install)


# What's this?

A good person named Tobias has contributed a shell script that can be used on a new Fedora installation to make the inital setup painless.

The original script repository found at: https://git.furworks.de/tobias/fedora-install

I "stole" his script and made many changes that suit me (probably crappy changes :3 ) and now I want to put those changes back so he can review them.

Since then, I've tested my changes on a number of fresh installs and they've worked as expected.

This repo will have 2 commits.

1. The original script pulled from upstream.
2. All the changes I've made.

## why?

It's easy for people to compare the changes by looking at the diff between commit #1 and #2 and then you can decide if they're crap :( 

# A token of thanks to Tobias :)

If it wasn't for this guy, I'd never get out of my laziness and cook myself those changes (no painfull reformats, yay!).

# Note

I've purposedly removed my vagrant boxes and ssh creds for reasons all too obvious. Apart from that, most of it stays intact.
